# High-Level Architecture and Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level architecture and the structured development steps required to complete the Clinic Scheduling Application. The application calculates and manages monthly work schedules for doctors based on constraints and preferences.

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Database Layer (SQLAlchemy with SQLite)**
  - Handles data storage, migrations, and schema.
  - Manages tables for Doctors, Schedules, and Shifts.

- **Data Access Layer (DAO)**
  - Provides CRUD operations to interact with the database.

- **Repository Layer**
  - Enforces business rules and applies validations for core entities.

- **Service Layer**
  - Implements complex scheduling algorithms and optimization rules.

- **API/Controller Layer**
  - Exposes REST endpoints to handle HTTP requests from the frontend.

- **Authentication/Authorization**
  - Ensures secure user access with JWT tokens.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework Options:**
  - **React.js or Angular** for Client-Side Rendering (CSR).
  - Flask/Django templates for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- **UI Components:**
  - Calendar view for scheduling.
  - Forms for entering doctor preferences.
  - Tables to display schedules.

### External Libraries and Tools
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM for database interaction.
- **Alembic** - Schema migrations.
- **PyJWT** - Authentication.
- **Pydantic** - Input validation.
- **FullCalendar.js** - Frontend calendar view.
- **Docker** - Containerization.
- **Postman/Selenium** - API and end-to-end testing.

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Database and Models
- Design and define database schema.
- Implement SQLAlchemy ORM models.
- Create migrations with Alembic.
- Test database initialization and data insertion.

### Step 2: DAO and Repository Layers
- Build DAOs for low-level data operations.
- Create repositories to enforce business rules.
- Test DAO and repository functionalities.

### Step 3: Service Layer
- Implement scheduling logic and constraints.
- Optimize shift assignments using algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms).
- Add manual edit and recalculation features.
- Test business logic with unit tests.

### Step 4: API/Controller Layer
- Define RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Add endpoints for schedule generation, approval, and recalculation.
- Document APIs with Swagger.
- Test endpoints using Postman or automated tools.

### Step 5: Authentication and Authorization
- Add JWT-based authentication.
- Implement role-based access control for admin users.
- Protect endpoints requiring authentication.

### Step 6: Frontend Development
- Design and implement the user interface.
- Integrate the frontend with backend APIs.
- Build features like calendar input, schedule preview, and manual edits.
- Test UI interactions with Selenium.

### Step 7: Testing and Validation
- Perform unit tests for each layer.
- Conduct integration tests for data flow between layers.
- Simulate edge cases (e.g., 100+ doctors) for scalability.

### Step 8: Deployment and Documentation
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Test local deployment with Docker Compose.
- Prepare deployment pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Write detailed deployment and user documentation.

## Key Constraints and Business Rules
1. Doctors cannot have consecutive shifts.
2. Doctors cannot exceed a set number of shifts per month.
3. Shifts should maximize gaps between workdays.
4. Preferences for specific off-days must be respected.
5. Minimize weekend assignments to two or fewer.
6. Manual edits must maintain constraint validation.

---

## Deliverables
1. Fully functional backend with RESTful APIs.
2. Interactive frontend UI for schedule management.
3. Authentication and authorization system.
4. Comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and UI).
5. Deployment-ready Docker configuration.
6. Documentation including API reference and user guide.

---

## Next Steps
1. Finalize service layer logic and testing.
2. Implement API layer and connect it with the frontend.
3. Add authentication and role management.
4. Focus on testing and deployment readiness.
