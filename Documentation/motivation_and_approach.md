# Efimeria - Goals, Motivation, and Approach

## Motivation

Creating monthly schedules for clinics is a complex and time-consuming task. As someone with close friends in the medical field, I’ve observed their struggles with balancing personal preferences, avoiding conflicts, and adhering to constraints while ensuring fair workloads. These challenges often lead to hours of manual work and frustration.

Efimeria was developed to simplify this process. The goal is to automate scheduling, reduce administrative overhead, and create fair, adaptable schedules that accommodate both the needs of the clinic and the preferences of the doctors. This project aims to save time and alleviate the stress associated with manual scheduling.

## Problem Background

The problem of scheduling doctors falls under the **Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP)**, a well-documented combinatorial optimization problem. The NSP involves assigning personnel to shifts while satisfying both:
- **Hard Constraints**: Such as ensuring all shifts are covered and avoiding overlapping assignments.
- **Soft Constraints**: Like respecting personal preferences, avoiding consecutive shifts, and distributing workloads fairly.

The NSP is classified as **NP-hard**, meaning the complexity of finding an optimal solution grows exponentially as the problem size increases. As a result, traditional optimization methods are often impractical for real-world applications.

## Approach

To address this challenge, Efimeria employs a **genetic algorithm** for schedule optimization. Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and are highly effective for solving large, complex problems with multiple constraints.

### Why a Genetic Algorithm?

1. **Scalability**: It handles the exponential growth in solution space effectively.
2. **Flexibility**: Allows the integration of hard and soft constraints into the fitness evaluation.
3. **Practicality**: While not guaranteeing optimal solutions, it consistently generates high-quality schedules.

### How It Works
1. **Encoding**: Each solution (or "individual") represents a potential schedule, encoded as a sequence of shift assignments.
2. **Fitness Function**: Evaluates the quality of a schedule based on:
   - Coverage of required shifts (hard constraints).
   - Adherence to preferences and avoidance of consecutive shifts (soft constraints).
3. **Selection**: Fitter schedules are more likely to be selected for reproduction.
4. **Crossover and Mutation**: Introduce variability to explore new solutions while refining existing ones.
5. **Termination**: The process stops when solutions converge or reach a set number of iterations.

## Inspiration

The approach was inspired by the article [Solving Nurse Scheduling Problems in Python](https://medium.com/@muafirathasnikt/solving-nurse-scheduling-rostering-problems-in-python-d44acc3ed74f), which demonstrates the practicality of using genetic algorithms for scheduling tasks. This article highlighted how genetic algorithms can be adapted to prioritize clinic-specific needs, balancing between meeting hard constraints and optimizing for soft constraints.

By building on this foundation, Efimeria provides a robust scheduling tool tailored to the unique challenges of clinic management, offering a balance between efficiency, fairness, and adaptability.

## Goals

1. **Simplify Scheduling**: Automate the process to save time and reduce manual effort.
2. **Ensure Fairness**: Balance workloads while considering personal preferences.
3. **Enhance Flexibility**: Allow for manual edits to adapt to last-minute changes.
4. **Deliver Practical Solutions**: Provide high-quality, realistic schedules that meet clinic needs.

Efimeria is not just a technical solution—it’s a tool designed to make life easier for doctors and administrators, letting them focus on what matters most: patient care.
